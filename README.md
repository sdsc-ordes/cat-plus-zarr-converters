# Cat+ Zarr Converters 

## Summary

This repository contains all the Zarr converters for the different data types in the Cat+ project (Agilent, UV, IR, etc.)

The data types are all in different formats, their data and metadata colluded together. The goal will be to convert the metadata to [an established ontology](https://github.com/sdsc-ordes/cat-plus-ontology/tree/main), and -as much as data format allow- convert the data in [Zarr array](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
