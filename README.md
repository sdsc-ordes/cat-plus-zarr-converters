# Cat+ Zarr Converters 

> [!WARNING]
> This is a WIP repository, it is not yet stable.


## Summary

This repository contains all the Zarr converters for the different data types in the Cat+ project (Agilent, UV, IR, etc.)

The data types are all in different formats, their data and metadata colluded together. The goal will be to convert the metadata to [an established ontology](https://github.com/sdsc-ordes/cat-plus-ontology/tree/main), and -as much as data format allow- convert the data in [Zarr array](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). 

## Installation guidelines

The project can be started in VS Code via a dev container

## How to Use
